The Intel® 8085A is a complete 8 bit parallel Central Processing Unit (CPU).
Its instruction set is 100% software compatible with the 8080A microprocessor, and it is designed to improve the present 8080A's performance by higher system speed.
Its high level of system integration allows a minimum system of three IC's (8085A (CPU), 8156 (RAM/IO) and 8355/8755A (ROM/PROM/IO) while maintaining total system expandability.
The 8085A-2 is a faster version of the 8085A.

The 8085A incorporates all of the features that the 8224 (clock generator) and 8228 (System controller) provede for the 8080A, Thereby offering a high level of system integration.

The 8085A uses a multiplexed data bus. The address is split between the 8 bit address bus and the 8 bit data bus. The on-chip address latches of 8155/8156/8355/8755A memory products allow a direct interface with the 8085A.
